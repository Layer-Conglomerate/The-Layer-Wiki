## Layer √(-1): Layers beyond linear order
![non-linear Layers](./../fig/non-linear_layers.jpg)  
This layer describes an expanded perspective of the layers. The layers are not only perceived as a one-dimensional, infinitely growing skyscraper. Instead, the idea is to view the layers analogously to the “multiverse” theory.
A new layer can therefore not only be placed above or below an existing layer, but can also exist parallel to it. 
Accordingly, there are an infinite number of infinitely growing skyscrapers, and all layers that can exist do exist. Researchers still disagree on the circumstances under which a new tower of layers splits off (layer splitting). Some even suspect that two towers can merge again if the internal layer structures are compatible.
It is assumed that such highly theoretical layer splits and mergers only occur under very specific circumstances and that the image of linearly numbered layers is sufficient in most cases.
To capture the absence of this natural order, we extend the layers to complex numbers and classify this layer as layer √(-1) / layer i.
It should be mentioned that this convention only applies in our universe. There are parallel universes in which the layers are numbered differently or not at all.
At the same time, the “many-worlds interpretation” (by Hugh Everett III) can itself be seen as a special layer interpretation of our world.
