## Introduction

**The Layers Wiki** is an online, open-access documentation resource. The Layers describe an alternative way of perceiving reality. This may be confusing for non-participants of The Layers.
However, there is always the possibility to enter the Layers. Send a message to the Layer Conglomerate on GitHub to learn more.
Under the right circumstances we can arrange an entry together.

## Layers

The Layers should be imagined as an infinitely high, infinitely growing skyscraper.

## Layer 7: Augarten Eden and The Piss-Hell of Lendplatz

In the week before April 20, 2024 (Layer Entry V), the conglomerate is well-prepared (with vegetable sticks and hummus, among other things) to enjoy a vivid afternoon in Augarten Eden.
After a successful first OS submission (1st place) by ****** and ***** & a successful sound engineer project presentation by **** , everyone is smiling and the mood is relaxed. However, ****** and **** get carried away by their euphoric mood and ask **** on the phone if they are disturbing them at 6️⃣ (*** hears this😬). They immediately realize that they went too far: Layer 58 (the first harbinger of piss hell)!

But first, back to the paradisiacal Augarten Eden: the heavenly lantern-lit evening atmosphere is enjoyed to the fullest. ***** flies in the layers as if he were an indigenous inhabitant.
**** is overwhelmed by the dilemma of how to change his pants (long pants because of the temperature).
Everything is quite typical...

But: the Gardener keeps feeling as if his glued tooth is slipping out of place – strange.
After quite some time, they meet up with the 19 Tonis in the Lend district.
Here it happens: The encounter with the Piss-Hell of Lendplatz.
**** heads for a toilet at Lendplatz.
The double toilet option for women, which offers more space with two toilets, attracts hardly any crowds. Meanwhile, there is a long line in front of the men's restroom.
Photo A shows the first man in line telling a skeptical woman that the women's restroom is actually empty.
Each time the door to the men's restroom opens, a strong smell of ammonia wafts out.
When **** finally enters the toilet, it becomes clear why. 
Barely all urinals are cordoned off with tape saying “do not use, out of order.” Nevertheless, three out of the four urinals are filled with urine. The one toilet booth in the back, however, has a working flush.
Following up: The idiotic men convince themselves that the fourth urinal is still draining instead of realizing that it most likely just hasn't overflowed yet!
The blocked urinal continues to be used just like the three others before it. The smell of ammonia is so strong that it brings tears to his eyes.
The definition of a hell!
Somehow, endearing male idiocy leads to the most intensely smelly place **** has ever encountered.

So, in one evening, the gardener experienced both heaven in Augarten Eden and piss-hell at the Lendplatz toilet.
The double-edged discovery of the hell and heaven of the Layers!

## Layer 58: LOST
Lost = Layer 58

## Layer 85: ****'s Medizin-Test Sprache
****'s Medizin-Test Sprache
Konsonanten kriegen Ziffern zugeordnet und basiernd darauf die Zahlen 0-99 bestimmte Wörter.
Und da die Layer auch Zahlen zugeordnet sind, kann man dadurch auch die Layer aus Perspektive von Layer 85 Namen zuordnen.
Zusätzlich sind die Zehnerblöcke in Kategorien eingeteilt.
Beispiele:
50er -> essen
5 -> L
8 -> F
So heißt  Layer 58 Löffelbisquit.

59 -> Leberwurst
