## Introduction


**The Layers Wiki**  is an online open access documentation. For non-participants of The Layers, this might be confusing.
However there is always the possibility to enter the Layers. Therefore send a message to the  Layer Conglomerate on github.

Under the right circumstances we can arrange an entry together.
